C++ template madness

## Description

C++ has a metaprogramming feature called templates. For this challenge, we want you to use C++ templates in a _creative_ way. Build a programming language. Write a neat data-structure. Maybe even write a game? C++ template metaprogramming is Turing complete. The sky is the limit.

Here are some resources to get you started:
- [C++ Templates](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/templates)
- [C++ Templates are Turing Complete](https://rtraba.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/cppturing.pdf)
- [Fibonacci numbers using C++ Templates](https://gist.github.com/toch/7ed3a1786d0ed464fd94)	
- [Curiously Recurring Template Pattern](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/crtp)

- [Practical Makefiles](http://nuclear.mutantstargoat.com/articles/make/?utm_source=pocket_mylist)
- [CMake Tutorial](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html)

**Do not submit source code from an existing project. You will be disqualified.**

The winner will be determined by the HexCommons team.
